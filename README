==== mashm ====
low-tech keymash mechanism: generates keymashes on demand

==== mashx ====
dangerous X11-enriched mashm extension: automatically types keymashes into
your programs (read "WARNINGS")



REQUIREMENTS
- cargo
- internet, probably
- (runtime, mashx) xdotool



BUILDING
$ cargo build --release
the binaries are output in `target/release/{mashm,mashx}`



RUNNING
$ mashm # prints a 20-char keymash to stdout
$ mashm -l1000 # prints a 1000-char keymash to stdout
$ mashx # automatically types a 20-char keymash (read "WARNINGS")
        # attach to a keybind for extra fun
-h can be used on either binary



INSTALLATION
a couple options:
- copy `target/release/{mashm,mashx}` to a directory in `$PATH`
- $ cargo install --path .
  - you will need to add `$HOME/.cargo/bin` to `$PATH`



WARNINGS
using mashx is unadvised:
- pressing control or alt while mashx is typing can cause interesting results
- letting mashx type in vim's normal mode or vim-like apps can cause
  interesting results
- releasing control or alt while mashx is typing causes X11 to erroneously
  assume the key is still being held (tap the key to fix this)
