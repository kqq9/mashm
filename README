==== mashm ====
low-tech keymash mechanism

==== mashx ====
dangerous X11-enriched mashm extension



REQUIREMENTS
- cargo
- internet, probably
- (runtime, mashx) xdotool



BUILDING
$ cargo build --release
the binaries are output in `target/release/{mashm,mashx}`



INSTALLATION
a couple options:
- copy `target/release/{mashm,mashx}` to a directory in `$PATH`
- $ cargo install --path .
  - you will need to add `$HOME/.cargo/bin` to `$PATH`



USAGE
$ mashm # generates a 20-char keymash
$ mashm -l1000 # generates a 1000-char keymash
$ mashx # attach this to a keybind for extra fun



WARNINGS
using mashx is unadvised:
- pressing control or alt while mashx is typing can cause interesting results
- letting mashx type in vim's normal mode or vim-like apps can cause
  interesting results
- releasing control or alt while mashx is typing causes X11 to erroneously
  assume the key is still being held (tap the key to fix this)
